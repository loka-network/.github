## 🎯 Overview

**Loka** is the financial operating system for the agentic economy. As artificial intelligence becomes a primary economic actor, it requires a new monetary layer—one that operates at machine speed, is programmatically verifiable, and settles value based on compute, not just balances.

### The Core Problem: Capital Velocity Bottleneck

The next $10 trillion of GDP will be generated by machines, but money still moves at human speed. Existing financial rails, including traditional stablecoins, were not designed for the high-frequency, low-friction, and continuous nature of machine-to-machine transactions. This creates a fundamental **capital velocity problem**, where AI's potential is bottlenecked by antiquated financial infrastructure.

Loka solves this by creating a closed-loop system where compute consumption is directly tied to monetary settlement, enabling a new generation of autonomous economic activity.

## 🏗️ The Loka Capitalization Stack

Loka provides a full-stack solution to transform compute into a liquid, monetizable asset class. This enables capital to flow at the speed of intelligence.

| Layer                      | Description                                   | Function                                                                                                    |

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ Agentic-Native Primitives

- **Zero-Fee A2A Payments**: Streaming micropayments via a hypergraph state network, enabling machine-scale transactions without economic friction.
- **Instant Cryptographic Finality**: Off-chain settlement with on-chain security guarantees, providing the determinism required for autonomous systems.
- **Credit-Native Money**: A behavior-based credit system where an agent's on-chain reputation and reliability unlock 'pay-after-use' capabilities and priority routing.
- **Programmable Governance & Compliance**: Embed rules and policies directly into the financial layer, allowing humans to set boundaries while agents execute transactions autonomously.

### 🔐 Secure & Scalable by Design

- **TEE-Secured Execution**: Core services, including the multi-tenant signing engine, run in AWS Nitro Enclaves, ensuring private keys and sensitive logic are physically isolated and cryptographically verifiable.
- **Hybrid Settlement Architecture**: Combines a high-performance EVM-compatible L1 (Loka Chain) for final settlement with a Lightning-inspired off-chain network for high-frequency payments.
- **Multi-VM & Parallel Execution**: Loka Chain supports EVM and WASM runtimes with a Block-STM engine, achieving 30k+ TPS while maintaining full compatibility.

### 🏢 Enterprise-Ready Solutions

- **Compute-Backed Stablecoin (AIUSD)**: A modular solution for issuing stablecoins collateralized by tokenized compute revenue streams.
- **High-Performance DEX**: An on-chain order book with a 1ms matching engine, designed for trading compute futures and other agentic assets.
- **Built-in Compliance & Auditability**: Features like KYC whitelisting, complete audit logs, and structured metadata (ISO 20022-style) for seamless enterprise integration.

## 💵 Core Product: AIUSD

**AIUSD is the native currency of the agentic economy.** Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins, AIUSD's value is derived from and backed by the productive output of compute. It is the pricing and settlement unit for AI-native value flows.

| Dimension            | Traditional Stablecoins      | AIUSD                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Unit of Value**    | Fiat Balance (e.g., USD)     | Verifiable Compute Usage           |
| **Backing Logic**    | Cash & T-Bills               | Tokenized Compute Cashflows & RWAs |
| **Settlement Model** | Transactional, Balance-Based | Continuous, Usage-Based            |
| **Credit Source**    | External (Banks, KYC)        | Endogenous, Behavior-Generated     |
| **Target User**      | Humans & Institutions        | AI Agents & Autonomous Systems     |
